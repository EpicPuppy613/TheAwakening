            The Awakening: A Custom Mindustry Experience
        </h1>
        <h3>
            You wake up and find yourself in a strange place, it seems like you are in a deep chamber underground. In the dim light there is, you can barely make out alien looking glyphs on the walls. There is a ship nearby, you board it.<br>
            The controls on the ship seem so familiar, yet so vague. You start the ship up, and start exploring.
        </h3>

            The Awakening is a custom Mindustry campaign made by EpicPuppy613.<br>
            This website is your guide, you will not be able to fully experience the campaign without it.<hr>
            In case you don't have Mindustry, you can get it here from <a href="https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry" target=_EMPTY>itch.io</a> or here from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/" target=_EMPTY>Steam</a>.<br>
            This campaign should function properly in Mindustry v6.x, and using other versions may break it.<hr>
            There are 2 ways to experience this campaign, doing the full experience, where you have to set custom rules for yourself to do, or the basic version, which only contains the maps and win conditions.
