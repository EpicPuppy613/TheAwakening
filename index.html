            The Awakening: A Custom Mindustry Experience
        </h1>
        <h3>
            You wake up and find yourself in a strange place, it seems like you are in a deep chamber underground. In the dim light there is, you can barely make out alien looking glyphs on the walls. There is a ship nearby, you board it.<br>
            The controls on the ship seem so familiar, yet so vague. You start the ship up, and start exploring.
        </h3>

            The Awakening is a custom Mindustry campaign made by EpicPuppy613.<br>
            This website is your guide, you will not be able to fully experience the campaign without it.<hr>
            In case you don't have Mindustry, you can get it here from <a href="https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry" target=_EMPTY>itch.io</a> or here from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/" target=_EMPTY>Steam</a>.<br>
            This campaign should function properly in Mindustry v6.x, and using other versions may break it.<hr>
